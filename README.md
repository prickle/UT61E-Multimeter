![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prickle/UT61E-Multimeter/main/Images/ut_prog.png)

A simple Windows program to display readings from the serial interface of the UNI-T UT61E Multimeter. This program will also probably work with other DMMs based on the Cyrustek ES51922 chipset that have a serial interface. (Don't know which they might be..)
